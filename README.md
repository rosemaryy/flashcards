# Flashcards

Study for classes and test your knowledge with easy to enter flashcards.

This program, run in terminal, allows you to mass enter flashcards, list all flashcards you've entered, as well as delete flashcards and list all the deleted flashcards.

The study function shows the query, or the "question" of the card. Upon user input, the program will show the answer to the question and ask for a rating that describes how well you knew the answer. Based on the ratings of the different cards, the program will test weaker-rated cards more than strongly-rated cards. This functionality allows for maximum effectiveness of study time.
